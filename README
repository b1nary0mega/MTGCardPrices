DESC: This program will download prices from TCGPlayer.com
      for paper cards. It will then list the High, Mid & Low
      values for each card.
      
      Currently this only performs the above stated actions
      for the Dragon's Maze set.
      
PLAN: Eventually this will be used to create a price list for
      my bots on MTGO.
      
MISC: I'm providing this program and ALL code AS IS. There are
      no guarantees, promises and/or agreements between myself
      and any user. I am in no way affiliated with TCG Player
      and they do not support this program, make any promises
      guarantees and/or agreements of any kind either in regards
      to this program.
